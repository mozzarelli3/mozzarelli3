<h1>#100DaysOfCode - Round 1</h1>

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Monday 8th July 2024].

## Log

### Day 1 - Intro to JS, and all things code!
Day 1, my first day at School of Code! After being away last week and catching up on the onboarding tasks, I felt ready to jump straight into learning code.
This week we're covering the basics of JavaScript through a the lens of a software engineer. Very excited but a little nervous.
By the end of the week I hope to be more confident in my code (as at the moment I know very basic HTML and CSS) and more confident in myself :).

### Day 2 - Objects and Arrays
Day 2 involved another day exploring JS. Today the topics were objects and arrays...

### Day 3 - Debugging and functions, functions, functions!
Today was day 3 of SoC, and my first full 9-5 day. Our tasks today included learning how to debug using console.log() and Chrome DevTools. Both were incredibly useful when completing the projects I was given.
Learning how to tag issues on github with the "bug" label and then fix these bugs directly when committing was an interesting glimpse into the coding work that happens in industry. 

### Day 4 - Very first Hackathon
Today is the day to start my first group project. We are building a rock, paper, scissors game using JS. So far this has proved to be challenging.
My team and I understand the basics and concepts of JS, but struggled with the best way to plan out how we tackle the game.
Eventually by the end of the session we got to a place where we have something that (kind of) works, although tomorrow we will have a big job trying to straighten everything out.
Hopefully a good nights sleep will help!

### Day 5 - Rock, Paper, Scissors!
My first SoC week complete! Today I finished off my rock, paper, scissors hackathon project with my team and presented it to Cohort#17.
Presenting and public speaking is not something that I enjoy, so I'm very pleased and proud that it went well. Our project worked really well, was structured nicely, and more importantly we were proud of what we had achieved.
Feedback to my team included very neat code (yay!), good and clear communication, but not to be too hard on ourselves. Overall very pleased with this week, I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next :).
