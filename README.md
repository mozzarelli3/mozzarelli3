<h2>#100DaysOfCode</h2>

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge during School of Code bootcamp. Started on [Monday 8th July 2024].

<details>
<summary><b>Week 1 - Javascript Basics</b></summary>

### Day 1 - Intro to JS, and all things code!
Day 1, my first day at School of Code! After being away last week and catching up on the onboarding tasks, I felt ready to jump straight into learning code.
This week we're covering the basics of JavaScript through a the lens of a software engineer. Very excited but a little nervous.
By the end of the week I hope to be more confident in my code (as at the moment I know very basic HTML and CSS) and more confident in myself :).

### Day 2 - Objects and Arrays
Day 2 involved another day exploring JS. Today the topics were objects and arrays...

### Day 3 - Debugging and functions, functions, functions!
Today was day 3 of SoC, and my first full 9-5 day. Our tasks today included learning how to debug using console.log() and Chrome DevTools. Both were incredibly useful when completing the projects I was given.
Learning how to tag issues on github with the "bug" label and then fix these bugs directly when committing was an interesting glimpse into the coding work that happens in industry. 

### Day 4 - Very first Hackathon
Today is the day to start my first group project. We are building a rock, paper, scissors game using JS. So far this has proved to be challenging.
My team and I understand the basics and concepts of JS, but struggled with the best way to plan out how we tackle the game.
Eventually by the end of the session we got to a place where we have something that (kind of) works, although tomorrow we will have a big job trying to straighten everything out.
Hopefully a good nights sleep will help!

### Day 5 - Rock, Paper, Scissors!
My first SoC week complete! Today I finished off my rock, paper, scissors hackathon project with my team and presented it to Cohort#17.
Presenting and public speaking is not something that I enjoy, so I'm very pleased and proud that it went well. Our project worked really well, was structured nicely, and more importantly we were proud of what we had achieved.
Feedback to my team included very neat code (yay!), good and clear communication, but not to be too hard on ourselves. Overall very pleased with this week, I'm looking forward to seeing what comes next :).

<summary><b>Week 2 - Front End</b></summary>

### Day 8 - Graduation!
Although today was a very busy day, I still managed to squeeze in a little bit of coding :). I spent an hour on the SoC intro to the DOM workshop to get ready for the week. So far so good, just need to remember to use document. before using the functions like getElementById, for example.

### Day 9 - Frontend Development Week
First day back at SoC after the weekend and this week I will be covering all things frontend. Today we went through the Document Object Model (DOM), the importance of semantic HTML, and then started building a quiz website project with my new team for this week.
I also went through debugging with Chrome DevTools with my mentor which was very helpful, I plan to implement this throughout my projects to get comfortable with DevTools.

### Day 10 - Connecting HTML with JS
Today we made good progress with our quiz app. We pretty much finalised the html and css files and made a start on connecting it with our JS. At the moment this feels very out of reach and challenging, but a challenge I'm enjoying. My team have been brilliant at helping each other along and
making sure everyone has a good understanding of the code before moving forward. Feeling very optimistic.

### Day 11 -  Graduation #2
Thursday brought with it another graduation, this time for family. I didn't manage to get done as much as I would have liked in the evening, but I was still able to go through the code that was written by my team during the bootcamp session.

### Day 12 - QuizAcademy finish!
Quiz Academy app finished! This week was very rewarding getting our quiz app to work. Having not been in yesterday, I was concerned that I may have felt left behind but that was not the case, my team went through every bit of new code so I understood. We presented to the rest of the bootcampers
and recieved some good feedback on our code, final product, and presentation, so all in all week 2 has been a success. Bring on week 3!

<summary><b>Week 3 - Back End</b></summary>

### Day 14 - Backend begins
The first day of backend! So far back end was not what I was expecting. Whilst being as challenging as I expected, it was far more enjoyable than what I thought it would be. Today I learned about node.js, npm, .json, and using node express.
By the end of the week I hope to be able to successfully complete the different types of requests, such as GET and POST requests.

### Day 15 - All about APIs
Today we started our project for the week! This week we are aiming to create our own REST API using node.js and Express. I expect this will be a challenging task, as so far I've been used to having a visual product. I think this project will test me but
I'm excited to see how far it can push me.

### Day 16 - GET, PUT, POST
I made some good progress on my understanding of completing the different kinds of requests (GET, PUT, POST, etc.). I successfully applied these to the project and I think I'm slowly starting to get the hang of it all.

### Day 17 - File systems in JS
Today I spent the morning continuing with our project, made some good progress, then spent the rest of the session completing a workshop on using the file system in node.js. This I found very challenging, we weren't able to complete the first ticket as we had so many errors, but after a discussion on the SoC slack, it is starting to make a little more sense. Looking forward to finishing up the REST API tomorrow and presenting it to the rest of the cohort.

### Day 18 - Backend Hackathon
Final day of the week and today is hackathon presentation day! This week has been tough, and a change from familiarity but I have enjoyed it far more than expected. The presentation went well, the team and I got good feedback. We almost finished all the tasks (GET, POST, PUT requests), but didn't manage to finish the DELETE request. Today, I also had a productive meeting with my mentor.

<summary><b>Week 4 - Databases and SQL</b></summary>

### Day 21 - Recap of backend
Monday marked the first day of database week, but instead of jumping straight in, we are going back over the fundamentals of last week's backend project. This should set us up nicely to be able to incorporate it with what we learn in SQL this week when we start the hackathon.

### Day 22 - SQL!
Today I started learning SQL. So far, it feels like a very nice language to use - it's very readable and logical. I have completed a few basic SQL workshops to start this week off. I'm hoping by the end of this week I will feel more confident with backend code.

### Day 23 - SQL Murder Mystery
Within the bootcamp, my team and I were tasked with solving a murder using SQL. It was a great way to put our newly found SQL skills to the test and cement our knowledge. It was a fab game, and everyone enjoyed playing it. After this, I had another online SQL workshop to complete. This has left me feeling more confident with SQL.

### Day 24 - SQL and REST API
Today was the day we connected SQL to everything we had done last week. As part of this weeks hackathon, we are connecting a REST API to a database using Postgres. This so far has been challenging, but a great way to recap last weeks skills. Bring on tomorrow!

### Day 25 - SQL and REST API continued
The time came around to yet again present the team's project to the cohort. We managed to complete most of the requests in time for the demo which was great. The presentation went well, the team and I had great feedback, and I was proud of what we had achieved this week.

<summary><b>Week 5 - Quality Assurance and Testing</b></summary>

### Day 28 - Testing testing, 1 2 3
The first day of testing! Today we delved into the world of testing by starting with a workshop on unit testing. This involved writing basic tests for a calculator app and ensuring that they pass. I found this very satisfying once I was able to pass all of the tests!

### Day 29 - TDD
Today we delved more into unit testing and the use of test-driven development (TDD). This was a challenging mindset shift at first - it felt unnatural to write tests before writing any functions as I wasn't confident initially that the tests that I was writing were correct. Upon reflection I can see how TDD would be really beneficial.

### Day 30 - API testing
Today we had another talk by expert QA engineers about the use of testing within the industry. It was incredibly interesting to hear the importance of testing, and the issues and problems that can arise if not completed. After this my team and I completed a workshop on linking our knowledge of backend API and testing. This was a fun challenge, as it gave another chance to recap our skills from previous weeks.

### Day 31 - End to end testing
The day of end-to-end testing. This was far more enjoyable to me than unit testing.

### Day 32 - CodeWars Hackathon
For this weeks hackathon we were tasked with creating a code kata for the other bootcampers to have a go at. This was an incredibly fun hackathon, and felt quite different to the other ones I have completed so far. One of the hardest parts I found was to come up with a story for the game itself. In reflection on this week, I think I need to spend some time focusing on TDD and completing more CodeWars katas to improve my function writing ability.

<summary><b>Week 6 - React</b></summary>

### Day 35 - Recap of HTML and CSS
A very fun day of recreating a very basic website using HTML and CSS to prepare us for learning React tomorrow! I always really enjoy working with HTML and CSS, it's always a little challenging perfecting the styling but I find great satisfaction once it is done.

### Day 36 - Components and Props
The first day of React. At first it felt odd to be putting "HTML" inside of a Javascript function, but the more my team and I completed within our workshop, the more it started to make sense. So far, so good.

### Day 37 - State and Events
Today was looking at state and props. The workshop looked at creating a pop-out menu that opens once a menu button is clicked, and then disappears when clicked again. This was done passing through props and using useState.

### Day 38 - Hackathon Prep
Half of today looked at wrapping up the workshop started yesterday, the other half was looking at and planning the hackathon task ready for tomorrow. I've enjoyed that the hackathon task directly links with all the workshops I have done this week, it feels like a very natural progression.

### Day 39 - React Hackathon!
The day of the hackathon. This week's task was to build on the website we had already been creating, and to implement some useState and useEffect to create a review section that links to an API. The website was planned to show three separate buttons that corresponded to Wales, England, and Scotland, and once clicked, display a review from that country. My team and I successfully completed this, and presented well.

<summary><b>Week 7 - React part II</b></summary>

### Day 42 - Recapping React
Before jumping into more React learning, we took the day to work within our teams on a workshop recapping all of the skills we had learned last week. This was really beneficial to help solidate my learning before moving on to more topics. The workshop today involved recreating a small flashcard website using a form to input the user's choice of flashcard questions and answers.

### Day 43 - Creating Forms in React
Today's workshop consisted of adding a form to the Fireplace Palace website my team and I created last week to allow "customers" to submit a booking for a one-to-one design consultation instead of having access to the business's phone number. Working on the same project for two weeks has been really beneficial, it has been a natural progression from one website feature to another. My team and I successfully created the form for mobile use, if we had more time then we would need to also create this for desktop, too.

### Day 44 - useReducer
The long day of Wednesday at SoC has arrived for this week! Today has been a good introduction to using useReducer in React to streamline our submission forms within my team's website. This has been challenging to convert our pre-existing code using a useState function into code that uses the useReducer function, but I think this way of going about the workshop provided me with a better understanding, rather than just typing our a useReducer from scratch.
